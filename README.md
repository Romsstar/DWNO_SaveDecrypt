# DWNO SaveDecrypt
This tool can decrypt and re-encrypt Savegames from Digimon World Next Order.
The game has a checksum which is written when the savegame is re-encrypted, allowing for Savegame Modification.
In addition you can resign the Savegame to another Steam ID. It has two approaches for that:
It will look for any existing Savedata on your computer and identify the SteamID associated with them. (Windows only)
This will be useful if you got a Savegame from the internet and wish to use it. 
Alternatively it allows for user Input so you can resign it to any other SteamID you wish. 

# Usage
The tool is Command Line Input and works with arguments. 
But for simple convenience you can just drag and drop the savefile onto the tool. It will check if its an encrypted or decrypted savegame.
If it's encrypted it will decrypt it so you can do your editing and stuff. If you then drag it on the tool again, it will ask for any resigning operations
and encrypt the savegame afterwards. That's it.
